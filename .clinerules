# Engineering Best Practices

## Core Philosophy
- **Simplicity First**: Write the simplest solution that works
- **Readability Over Cleverness**: Code is read far more often than written
- **Maintainability is King**: Easy to understand and modify beats optimal performance in most cases
- **Start Simple, Add Complexity Only When Absolutely Needed**: Don't anticipate future requirements

## Code Quality Principles

### Clean Code Standards
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid deep nesting - prefer early returns and guard clauses
- Remove commented-out code - use version control instead
- Delete unused code, imports, and dependencies

### Simplicity Guidelines
- Minimize the number of lines of code needed to achieve the goal
- Avoid over-engineering and premature optimization
- Use built-in language features before adding external dependencies
- Prefer straightforward solutions over "clever" tricks
- If you can't explain it simply, simplify it

### DRY Principle
- Don't Repeat Yourself - extract common patterns
- But don't abstract too early - wait until you see the pattern 3 times
- Balance DRY with readability - sometimes duplication is better than wrong abstraction

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't add functionality until it's actually needed
- No speculative features or "just in case" code
- Build for today's requirements, not imagined future ones

## Project Structure
- Keep related files close together
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type (when it makes sense)

## Code Reviews & Refactoring
- Continuously refactor to keep code simple
- If adding a feature makes code complex, refactor first
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Comments & Documentation
- Write self-documenting code first
- Comment the "why", not the "what"
- Keep comments up to date or remove them
- Document complex business logic and non-obvious decisions

## Testing Philosophy
- Write tests that give confidence without over-testing
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Keep tests simple and readable

## Remember
> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci
> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler
